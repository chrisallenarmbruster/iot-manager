# DCP implementation on esp32 microcontroller IoT device used in this project.

The DCP classes in this folder are implemented for the Moddable SDK in JavaScript. The Moddable SDK includes a JavaScript runtime engine for microcontrollers. Since the Moddable SDK does not have access to the same libraries and modules as Node.js, the DCP classes here are implemented using the Moddable SDK's built-in modules. Usage remains consistent with the DCP library for Node.js, but the implementation of the classes in this folder is specific to the Moddable SDK.
