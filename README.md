# IoT Manager

**IoT Manager** is my full-stack JavaScript implementation for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. It covers everything from sensors to the cloud, with a web-based human interface, back-end server, API, and IoT gateway. Additionally, it includes embedded JavaScript for IoT devices that seamlessly integrate with the server's IoT gateway.

## About

IoT Manager extends the common PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express, React/Redux, Node.js) to incorporate IoT technologies. Here's an overview of what you'll find in this project:

- **Embedded JavaScript**: Custom-tailored runtime environment for JavaScript that runs on IoT devices.
- **Lightweight TCP Messaging**: Efficient communication protocol for IoT devices.
- **IoT Gateway**: A central hub for IoT data that facilitates communication between devices and the web interface.
- **Real-time Data Streaming**: WebSocket support for real-time data streaming to web browsers.

## Live Environment

This repository includes a "live" environment where all dashboard values are based on real-time data received from actual IoT devices. The devices can be located locally at the developer's site and connect to the Internet via a local Wi-Fi network. .

## Challenges

One of the most significant challenges in this project was developing the embedded software and its runtime environment. The Espressif ESP32 microcontroller, while powerful and cost-effective, has limited resources compared to a typical client or server. This necessitated a custom build of the JavaScript runtime engine, tailored specifically for this application. Advanced packages commonly used in a Node.js environment, such as Express and Axios, were not available, leading to lower-level coding in JavaScript.
